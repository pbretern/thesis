## About the project
### Data driven support system of a special library for budget planning
The goal of the master thesis is the development and conception of a data-driven support system for budget planning and resource allocation of a hybrid special library. For this purpose statistical data will be collected, analyzed and graphically displayed. The goal is to demonstrate in a proof-of-concept how a general implementation can look like. The module-based system architecture will be used to develop such a proof-of-concept.
 
## Technical Information
to use and tweak it for your latex-project, 
you need to copy the `mimosis.cls` in your project-directory and 
add the `mimosis.cls` to `\documentclass{miomosis.cls}` in the document preamble.

## Inspiration
LaTex-Project based on Bastian Rieck (https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/latex-mimosis)
